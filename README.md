# Search for human homologs of genes or proteins found in C. Elegans

* Library which searches compara and wormbase for homologs of C. Elegans genes.
* Protein homologs can be identified with HHMER.
* In addition identified homologs are checked if they are expressed in the brain (using the human brain atlas) and known disease associations are retrieved from DisGenet.
